    I'm a Systems Engineer on Don't Panic (Ops Team) at OnShift. I was hired in March of 2015 as a developer on the Integrations Team and have moved over to the Ops Team as needs arose. I had a background as a full-stack PHP developer and bit of Operations experience before moving to OnShift. I now have plenty of experience with Ansible, Amazon Web Services, and various different types of hosting technologies.

    I've been a developer at OnShift since early 2015. Although I've been on several development projects, authentication has been an underlying focus for me. I'm an SME for our "auth app", a Flask web server application responsible for keeping users logged in across multiple domains, and handling federated ID integration with customers. I've also contributed to OnShift's mobile apps, which range from native iOS and Android apps to responsively designed single page web apps.
